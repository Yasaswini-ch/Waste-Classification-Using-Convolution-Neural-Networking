# Week-1
This project develops a CNN model to classify plastic waste into categories like "Bottles" or "Bags." Images are preprocessed, resized, and augmented for better training. A TensorFlow/Keras CNN with layers like Conv2D and MaxPooling is trained on the dataset and tested for accuracy, enabling automated waste sorting.
# Dataset
The dataset contains 25,000 images of plastic waste. Download it using the link below:
